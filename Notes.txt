Going to add a custom authentication logic 
and make Role base authorisation  (Blazor server app)

Step 1  :

Add a Authentication folder , all the authentication related files are going to be in this folder .
Create a class , CustomAuthenticationStateProvider and inherit it from AuthenticationStateProvider 
Abstract class .

What is AuthenticationSateProvider in Blazor ?

Its a built in service in blazor server apps to
get the authentiation data from the Asp.Net Core 's HttpContext.user 
(Basically it provides the authentication state of the current user via GetAuthenticationStateAsync method in it .)

Step 2 

Implement GetAuthenticationStateAsync method (which is an abstract method from AuthenticationStateProvider class).

Step 3

set up ClaimsPriciple and ProtectedSessionStorage objects in CustomAuthenticationStateProvider class.
And Add dependency injection for the protectedSessionStorage in program.cs file 

Step 4 

Set up GetAuthenticationStateAsync method . This is where we actually check if we have a valid user session available .If yes he will be assigned with the the corresponding 
claims (Names and Roles ) , else the authentiation state will be set to annonymous .

Step 5 

Set up UpdateAuthenticationState method

This will be called at the event of login and logout to set or delete the session variables .
